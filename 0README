==Install==

  The following programs are used:

    GNU Awk 4.1+
    GNU Parallel
    Wget
    Lua 5.2+      (for base62.lua)
    Python 3.4+   (for urldecoding functions)
    Python 2.7+   (mostly for Pywikibot)
    Pywikibot     (https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Pywikibot)

A. Download all files from GitHub into a directory (any name)
B. Run 'sh setup' to create sym links, set permissions and create temp directories.
C. Set the #!/usr/bin/awk at the top of the .awk files 
   Same with Lua in base62.lua and Python in savepage.py
D. Setup Pywikibot. This is the framework for logging in and sending changes to Wikipedia.

   a. Run the Pywikibot setup script if not already done during install.
   b. Copy savepage.py to where Pywikibot is located (same directory as user-config.py)
      Set executable (chmod 755 savepage.py)
   c. Set the path of Pywikibot (same as step b.) for Exe["pywikibotsavepage"] in init.awk
   d. Add a 'setenv PYWIKIBOT2_DIR <path>' pointing to the same path as step b. Add to your .login or .bashrc script
   e. Edit ~pywikibot/pywikibot/page.py
      Find the line: pywikibot.output(u"Page %s saved" % link)
      Right below it (same indent level) add the line: print "OKMEDIC"
   f. Edit ~pywikibot/pywikibot/throttle.py
      Find the line: message = (u"Sleeping for %(seconds).1f seconds
      Right above it add the line: sleep = 1

E. In init.awk, set paths to programs and directories 
F. In project.cfg, set the paths to the meta and data directories for default.data and default.meta
   The rest of this file can be left as-is.

==Initialize==

A. Make a list of articles that use the template. Use today's date in YMD format ending with .auth and place in ~/meta sub-directory

    ./wikiget -t t -b "Template:Wayback" > meta/wayback20161102.auth
    ./wikiget -t t -b "Template:WebCite" > meta/webcite20161102.auth

   This step only needs to be done once.

==Running==

A. Run wam

1. Create a new project files specifying the size of the batch (in this case 50, from 1-50)

    ./project -c -p wayback20161102.00001-00050

2. Run wam with GNU parallel

    parallel -a meta/wayback20161102.00001-00050/auth -r --delay 2 --trim lr -k -j 2 ./driver -d y -p wayback20161102.00001-00050 -n {}
